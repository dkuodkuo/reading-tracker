### [A Beginner's Guide to Data Engineering](https://medium.com/@rchang/a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-part-i-4227c5c457d7) (All 3 parts) (Read 2018-12-15)

- I needed to read this to ground myself
- Good structure to how a business should tackle the data problem
- Largely based on Airflow approach to ETL. Some cool patterns in part 3
- Note to self, way more time should be spent on learning data warehousing/engineering

### [Statistics for people in a hurry](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-for-people-in-a-hurry-a9613c0ed0b) (Read 2018-12-05)

- Ideally, be able to describe everything I do as succinctly as this

### [The most difficult thing in data science: politics](https://www.rdisorder.eu/2017/09/13/most-difficult-thing-data-science-politics/) (Read 2018-12-04)

- I read this and became a little more upset, but it's fine ðŸ˜Š

### [A Comparison of Basis Expansions in Regression](http://madrury.github.io/jekyll/update/statistics/2017/08/04/basis-expansions.html) (Read 2018-12-02)

- Includes small module for basis expansions: https://github.com/madrury/basis-expansions
- Goes over the shortcomings of polynomial expansions, particularly touching on dimensionality issues and overfitting
- Provides alternatives transformations: binning, piecewise linear splines, natural cubic splines
- Experiments to demonstrate alternative transformations
